# Ricky Greenwald â€“ Consent Agreement Summary (2018)

This file summarizes the **Consent Agreement** entered into by **Ricky Greenwald, Psy.D.**, as recorded by the **Massachusetts Board of Registration of Psychologists** under Investigative Intake Record No. 2017-000912-IT-ENF.

## Summary

In 2018, Ricky Greenwald entered into a formal Consent Agreement with the Massachusetts licensing board as an alternative to a disciplinary hearing. The record is a matter of public record and confirms the following:

- Ricky Greenwald admitted that he supervised **Bambi Rattner**, who was providing court-ordered trauma therapy to a minor child.
- He **acknowledged and admitted** that:
  - He took on a **child custody evaluator role** despite having financial ties and personal relationships with the childâ€™s father and/or stepmother.
  - These conflicts **compromised his impartiality** and exposed the child to harm.
  - In his supervisory role, he **reinforced a false trauma narrative**, which led Rattner to neglect the childâ€™s actual trauma â€” resulting in additional harm.
  - He **misinterpreted psychological assessments**, provided inadequate evaluations of both the child and mother, and built a treatment plan on faulty premises.
- Had the matter gone to hearing, the Board could have found him in violation of multiple **APA Ethics Code Standards**, including:
  - Standard 3.04: Avoiding harm  
  - Standard 3.05â€“3.06: Conflicts and multiple relationships  
  - Standards 9.01(b), 9.06: Assessments  
  - Standard 10.02(b): Informed consent and treatment

## Disciplinary Outcome

- Greenwaldâ€™s license was placed on **three years of probation**.
- He was ordered to:
  - Participate in **144 supervised sessions** with a licensed psychologist approved by the Board
  - Complete **six Board-approved continuing education units** in family systems, high-conflict divorce, assessments, and risk management
  - Submit **quarterly and final reports** from the Supervising Psychologist
  - Comply with in-person Board appearances and all terms at his own expense
